24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.
Ans. :

>> Inheritance vs. Polymorphism:
- Inheritance: Defines a relationship between classes where one class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from 
  another class (superclass).
- Polymorphism: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. 
  It enables a single interface to represent various types, supporting flexibility in code design.
