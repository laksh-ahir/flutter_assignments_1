22. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? What is the advantage of inheritance?
Ans. :

>> Dart supports single inheritance, Multiple inheritance is not supported in Dart. 
>> Because Multiple Inheritance helps avoid the complexities and ambiguities associated, promoting a simpler and more maintainable 
   code structure.

>> The advantage of inheritance lies in code reuse. By inheriting attributes and methods from a superclass, 
   a subclass can leverage existing functionality, reducing redundancy and promoting a modular and efficient codebase. 
   It also facilitates the creation of a class hierarchy, allowing for a more organized and intuitive structure in object-oriented programming.
